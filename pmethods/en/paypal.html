<h2 class="chapter-name">Tutorial: Buying Bitcoin with PayPal on VirWoX</h2>
<div class="nice-divider"></div>

<h2>1. <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/bitcoin_virwox" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open an account</a> on VirWoX</h2> 

<p>From the home page, click on “Not registered yet?”</p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/1.png" alt="register VirWoX" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="enter-the-details-for-your-account">2. Enter the details for your account</h2> 

<p>Now you’ll enter your details in order to create an account. Don’t get confused by the section titled “Link to avatar”. You can leave this untouched. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/2.png" alt="create account virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="check-your-email">3. Check your email</h2> 

<p>At this point, your account has been created. A temporary password will be emailed to the address you provided in step two. </p> 

<p><strong>This password is temporary and MUST be changed. If you don’t change this password within 24 hours your account will be deleted. We show you how to change your password in the next step.</strong></p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/3.png" alt="check email virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="change-your-password">4. Change your password</h2> 

<p>Once you login with your temporary password, click on “Change settings” in the left sidebar. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/4.png" alt="change password virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> <h2 id="create-a-new-password">5. Create a new password</h2> 

<p>Enter a new password. Make sure you choose a strong password, since you're dealing with money! </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/5.png" alt="create password virwox" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="deposit-from-paypal">6. Deposit from PayPal</h2> 

<p>Once you’ve changed your password, click on “Deposit” in the left sidebar. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/6.png" alt="deposit from paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="deposit-and-select-amount">7. Deposit and select amount</h2> 

<p>Scroll down a bit to find the option to deposit with PayPal. Enter the amount you want to deposit on the left and then click the “Checkout with PayPal” button. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/7.png" alt="change paypal for sll" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> <h2 id="login-to-paypal">8. Login to PayPal</h2> 

<p>Sign in to PayPal. Note on the left side that I'm depositing $2. This is the amount I chose back in step 7. If this amount is not what you chose, go back and enter a new amount. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/8.png" alt="login to paypal" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="verify-acccount-balance">9. Verify account balance</h2> 

<p>If you followed PayPal’s directions successfully, you should now see a balance in your VirWoX account. Note that the amount displayed in your VirWoX account may be slightly less than the amount you entered in step 7. This is because PayPal charges a 2.9% + $0.30 fee per deposit. </p> 

<p>After this, click on “USD/SLL”. If you deposited with Euro then click “EUR/SLL”. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/9.png" alt="check balance" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="trade-usd-for-second-life-lindens">10. Trade USD for Second Life Lindens</h2> 

<p>Remember how we said you’ll have to buy Second Life Lindens and then trade those for bitcoins? Well, now we’re buying the SLL. In this step you need to sell the USD you deposited from PayPal and get SLL. </p> 

<p>Enter the amount of USD you want to sell. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/10.png" alt="trade sll for usd" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="complete-order">11. Complete order</h2> 

<p>You can see in the top left of the image below that I now have a balance in SLL. If you now have SLL, that means everything has gone well. </p> 

<p>Now click on “BTC/SLL” in the left sidebar. Now we’re going to exchange our SLL for bitcoin. </p> <p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/11.png" alt="exchange" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="trade-sll-for-btc">12. Trade SLL for BTC</h2> 

<p>The process is the same here. Simply enter the amount of BTC you want to buy and click “Next”. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/12.png" alt="paypal to bitcoin" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p> 

<h2 id="buy-bitcoin">13. Buy bitcoin!</h2> 

<p>That’s it! You should now see your balance in BTC displayed in the top left of the screen. You’ve successfully bought bitcoin with PayPal. </p> 

<p><img src="/img/paypaltobtc/13.png" alt="buy bitcoin" class="img-responsive kb-helper" /></p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Is using VirWoX really the fastest and best way to buy bitcoins via PayPal?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, yes:</p>

<p>PayPal bans its users from selling bitcoins for PayPal funds.</p> 

<p>Even if sellers were allowed to accept PayPal for bitcoins, the risk of fraud and chargebacks would be too large and premiums/fees would likely be higher than VirWoX.</p>

<p>One way that may be better is if you are able to find a local dealer at a Bitcoin meetup. If someone you trust is willing to sell you bitcoins directly for PayPal, this a good option.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">As a PayPal merchant, can I accept bitcoins?</h3>
<p>There have been rumors of Bitcoin integration for PayPal merchants. At this time, however, this is still no way to accept bitcoins through PayPal's merchant tools.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Does PayPal Accept Bitcoin as a Deposit Method?</h3>
<p>You can't fund your PayPal account using Bitcoin from within PayPal.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>Using an exchange like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/Buy_Coinbase">Coinbase</a> you can sell bitcoins to your PayPal account.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Can I Buy Bitcoin with PayPal on Coinbase?</h3>
<p>No, you can only <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-adds-support-for-paypal-and-credit-cards-21968661d508#.ggj0cga2g">sell bitcoins from your Coinbase account</a> TO PayPal.</p>


<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Is There a PayPal Bitcoin Wallet?</h3>
<p>There <a href="https://qz.com/713528/paypal-is-warming-up-to-bitcoin/">have been rumors that PayPal has been planning</a> Bitcoin integration.</p>

<p>Even so, PayPal still has not integrated Bitcoin with its services.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">What is Paxful?</h3>
<p>Paxful is a LocalBitcoins type service that also allows people to buy bitcoin with PayPal. We don't list it here, though, since VirWoX is the main method we can recommend for now.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot-1">Should I leave my bitcoins on the exchange after I buy?</h3>
<p>We really recommend storing any bitcoins you want to keep safe in a wallet you own.</p>
<p>Many Bitcoin exchanges <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-07/hacked-bitcoin-exchange-users-to-lose-36-will-receive-tokens">have been hacked</a> and lost customer funds.

<p>Yes of course!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, you can use <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/Buy_Coinbase">Coinbase</a> in the USA and some of Europe. The fees for selling bitcoins to PayPal are 3.75% using Coinbase.</p>
<p>You can always reverse the process explained in this post, but that comes with the same crazy 10% fees.</p>

<p>If you get one thing from this article let it be this:</p>

<p>Don't store your bitcoins on exchanges!!!</p>

<div class="quote-box">
<p>I've been buying bitcoins for more than three years. I've never lost any money to scams or thefts. Follow the guidelines in this article and you'll be able to do the same.</p>

<div class="quote-ref"><img src="/img/icons/jtsmall.jpg"><a href="https://www.jordantuwiner.com/">Jordan Tuwiner</a> <span class="position">Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</span></div>

<p>Here are two examples where users got screwed by leaving bitcoins on exchanges:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack">Bitfinex hack where users lost $70 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt Gox where users lost $450 million or more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And there are many more I could list.</p>

<p>Make sure you <a href="/wallets/">get yourself a Bitcoin wallet</a> that will securely store your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Besides storage, there are many scam exchanges out to steal your credit card information and/or bitcoins.</p>

<p>Following these three basic principles should help you avoid theft, scams, and any other loss of funds:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Do research before buying on any exchange.</b> Check reviews, ratings, and regulation information.</li>
<li><b>Don't store coins on the exchange.</b> Already mentioned above but worth repeating.</li>
</ol>
